This responsitory is based on the book Higher Order Perl. Although I have a reading knowledge of Pearl, the information contained in the book is very readable and 'entertaining'. I particularly enjoy the analysis of the algorithms used and how they are implemented.  

And the website, [Higher Order Javascript](https://interglacial.com/hoj/hoj.html#HOJ.0:_Functional_JavaScript_Reviewed). This site is based on earlier versions of javascript and a lot of the language changes not shown.
